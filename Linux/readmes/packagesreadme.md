# individual_scripts/packages.sh

packages.sh goes through a blacklist of packages that are considered 'hacking tools'. In the future you will be able to select the blacklist you use, but currently it just uses one. The blacklist is located in data_files/packageBlacklist.txt if you would like to view/edit it. If you have other packages you would like in the blacklist, contact me at my github so I can take a look at it.
